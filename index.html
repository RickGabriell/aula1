    <h1> Letra Musica Euphoria-Zendaya</h1>
    
    <p>Oh, taking it all for us
        Taking it all
        Taking it all for us
        <p>Oh, doing it all for love
            Doing it all
            Doing it all for love
        </p>Taking it all for us, all
        Doing it all for love
        Yeah-eah, yeah-eah
        </p>Too much in my system (throbbin', throbbin')
        Money MIA (pockets hella empty)
        Mama makin' ends meet (makin' ends meet)
        Workin' like a slave (Mississippi, yay-aye)
